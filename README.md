LogisticRegression includes codes of Discrete Hamiltonian Descent for logistic regression experiments.

LogisticRegression_Parallel implements parallel Hamiltonian Descent based on Picard Iteration.

NonconvexHD includes several experiments on non-convex functions with Hamiltonian Descent, with comparison to Gradient Descent and Momemtum methods.
